# Journey_to_Aeolus-FabricMC
    Hello everyone! My name is Arthur.
    Journey to Aeolus: The Whistling Winds is a to-be Fabric Minecraft Adventure-Dimension Mod. The goal is to create a vast but beautiful world with many new blocks, a few mobs, a dungeon, a Guardian boss, 4 new armor sets, spears and other trinkets, etc.
    As the project grows i might ask more talented people than myself to contribute but for the moment i am the sole developer. 
    lol.
    wish me luck :')
